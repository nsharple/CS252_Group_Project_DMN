To Do:
1) Fix date restrictions in newlog.html and newgoal.html (new goal must have an end date after or on start date, but needs to have end date only today or after) (no logs set tomorrow or later needs done)
2) Gray out ONLY uncompleted goals (currently graying out any goal which has an end date before today's date)
3) Check on warning in console on webpage
